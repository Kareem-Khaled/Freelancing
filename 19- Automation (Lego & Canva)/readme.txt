First of all, you just need to edit one line to attach selenium to your edge account!

just edit "<your username>" with your username
"options.add_argument("user-data-dir=C:\\Users\\<your username>\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Edge\\User Data")"

Don't worry you need to do this step just one time!

After that, you need to run the "install.bat" file to install the requirements!

Then make sure you are closed all of the Edge pages and run the "run.py" file and that is it!
